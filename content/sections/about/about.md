As a child, I recall visiting a friend's house on a beautiful Sunday afternoon. Upon entering the dining room, my eyes were met with the sight of my first-ever computer: a Commodore CBM 8032. At the same time, my friends were playing the first computer game I had ever seen, Space Invaders. That moment, I fell in love with technology.

From that day on, I was determined to learn about computers and how to program. My fascination with technology never faded, and I was always eager to learn about new advancements and technologies that could improve our lives.

Playing video games, working with word processing, manipulating graphics, and using spreadsheets on the computer was not enough for me. I was driven to understand how the computer worked and create my own programs. I vividly recall a news article I saw on TV about young kids programming their own games instead of just playing them, which only fueled my passion further.

However, back then, there were many obstacles to learning how to program. The internet was still in its early stages, and books, compilers, and courses were expensive. Programming tools such as IDEs and debuggers were also scarce and expensive. Finding help was a challenge. I realized that the best way to learn about computers was to attend college.

So, I enrolled at the Radio College of Canada, where I learned how to program the 6800, 8088, and 68000 microprocessors. In addition to assembly language, I gained a deep understanding of how computers work, as well as a knowledge of analog electronics. I graduated with an Associates Degree in Electronics Technology.

I worked for a few years in electronics and as a Network Administrator, but I had to leave the industry due to a lack of funds to keep up with technology advancements. This was a painful experience, as my passion for learning refused to be extinguished.

In recent years, I made the decision to reignite my passion for programming by becoming a software engineer. My goal is to finally fulfill my lifelong dream of becoming a programmer.
