One sunny Sunday afternoon in my childhood, I wandered into a friend's dining room and locked eyes with the coolest thing I'd ever seen: a Commodore CBM 8032. It was love at first sight, especially with Space Invaders on screen, which was basically the equivalent of finding a unicorn in your backyard. From that day, I was on a mission to conquer the tech world, eager to learn everything from coding to why my VCR kept flashing at 12:00.

Determined to be more than just a gamer or a spreadsheet wizard, I wanted to crack open the computer's brain and dance with its circuits. Inspired by young tech prodigies on TV, I dreamed of programming my own blockbuster games. But the road was tougher than trying to beat a video game boss without the cheat codes. The internet was still learning to walk, programming books cost a fortune, and the tools I needed were as rare as a friendly chat about politics on social media.

After attending the  RCC Institute of Technology, where I learned electronics and graduated with a snazzy Associates Degree in Electronics Technology, I dipped my toes in the electronics and network administration pool. However, due to the tech world's insatiable appetite for the latest and greatest, I took a break, not by choice but by necessity. Fast forward to recent times, and here I am, reigniting my first love for programming. I'm on a quest to fulfill my childhood dream of becoming a software engineer, proving it's never too late to reboot your life and debug your dreams!
