I was at a very young age when I laid eyes on the very first computer I had ever seen, and at that moment, I fell in love.  From that point on, I had always wanted to learn how computers worked, and I wanted to learn to program.  I love technology and my entire life has always been excited to learn about new advancements and new technologies that were on the horizon to make our lives easier, and more comfortable.

It wasn’t enough for me to play a video game, do any wordprocessing, manipulating graphics images, or working on a spreadsheet on this new computer I had discovered.  The passion burned inside of me to learn how to program the computer myself.  To create my own programs and to understand exactly how it worked.  I distinctly remember watching a news article on TV where a couple of young kids were “programming their own games instead of playing them”.  The passion to program my own creations on the computer burned even more.  

Unfortunately, there were many barriers to learning to program back then.  The internet was in its infancy.  Books, compilers, and courses were expensive.   Programming tools, such as IDEs, and debuggers, were also in their infancy and expensive.  Getting help was a challenge.  I felt the best way I could possibly learn how computers worked was to go to college.

So, I studied at the Radio College of Canada, where I learned how to program the 6800, 8088, and 68000 microprocessors.  Aside from assembly language I also learned a lot of detail on how computers work.  I also learned a lot  about the analog side of electronics as well.  I finished college with an Associates Degree in Electronics Technology.

I worked for a few years in electronics and as a Network Administrator.  I had to leave the industry due to the lack of funds to keep up with technology.  This hurt the most because of my strong passion to learn that burns inside of me refused to be extinguished.

In the past few years, while deciding on where to go next in my life, I decided that I wanted to refuel my passion for programming by becoming a software engineer.  It became my goal to finally become the programmer that I had always wanted to be.
